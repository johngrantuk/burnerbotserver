      Access to the feed below is always on sale.
      <br>In order to own this access, you always have to specify a sale price.
      <br>Anyone can buy it from the current patron at any time for the specified sale price.
      Whilst held, a 5% fee (pa) is levied as patronage towards the feed owner.

    <h3>Hackathon Idea</h3>
      <br>The idea and
      <a href="https://github.com/simondlr/thisartworkisalwaysonsale" target="_blank">contracts</a> were taken from Simon de la Rouvieres
      <a href="https://thisartworkisalwaysonsale.com" target="_blank">'This Artwork Is Always On Sale'</a> - it's a cool implementation of a Harberger Tax.
      <br>My idea was to tweak the concept a little - NuCypher is used to encrypt the feed, then only the Patron can decrypt (using NuCypher) to get access.
      <br>The concept could be extended to have more than one Patron and could also be used for other kinds of feed data such as sensor data, camera/video feeds, music, etc.
